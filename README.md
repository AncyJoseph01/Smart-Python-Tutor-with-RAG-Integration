# **Description:**
This project is an AI Python Tutor that helps you learn Python more smartly. Instead of just giving answers, it uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Python textbook (PDF) as its knowledge source. That means when you ask a question, the tutor can explain the concept and even tell you the exact page number in the textbook where it’s explained.

The tutor is powered by the Gemini API for natural language responses. It runs on a backend built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic, and stores data in PostgreSQL. The frontend is built with React, giving you a smooth and interactive learning experience. Everything is packed in Docker, so it’s easy to run anywhere.

With this tutor, you don’t just get answers, you get clear explanations, page references, and an interactive way to learn Python step by step.
